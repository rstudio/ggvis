\title{Create a linked brush object.}
\usage{
linked_brush(keys, fill = "red")
}
\arguments{
\item{keys}{vector of all possible keys, if known.}

\item{fill}{brush colour}
}
\value{
A list with components:
  \item{input}{A function that takes a visualisation as an argument and
     adds an input brush to that plot}
  \item{selected}{A reactive providing a logical vector that describes

\description{
A linked brush has two sides: input and output

lb <- linked_brush(keys = 1:nrow(mtcars), "red")

# Change the colour of the points

# Display one layer with all points and another layer with selected points
