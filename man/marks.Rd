\arguments{
\item{vis}{Visualisation to modify}

\item{props,...}{A \code{\link{props}} object, named according to the
properties listed below.}

\item{data}{An optional dataset, if you want to override the usual data
inheritance for this mark.}
}
\description{
These functions create mark objects, corresponding to vega marks. Marks
are leaves in the plot tree, and control the details of the final rendering.
Marks are equivalent to the basic geoms in ggplot2 (e.g. point, line,
polygon), where ggvis layers correspond to combinations of geoms and
statistical transforms.

\details{
Note that by supplying a fill property to \code{mark_path} will produce
a filled property. \code{mark_point} is an alias to \code{mark_symbol}.

\section{Properties}{


You can set the following mark properties:

\itemize{
\item  x  The first (typically left-most) x-coordinate.
\item  x2 The second (typically right-most) x-coordinate.
\item  width The width of the mark (if supported).
\item  y The first (typically top-most) y-coordinate.
\item  y2 The second (typically bottom-most) y-coordinate.
\item  height The height of the mark (if supported).
\item  opacity The overall opacity.
\item  fill The fill color.
\item  fillOpacity The fill opacity
\item  stroke The stroke color.
\item  strokeWidth The stroke width, in pixels.
\item  strokeOpacity The stroke opacity.
\item  size [symbol] The pixel area of the symbol. For example in the case
  of circles, the radius is determined in part by the square root of the size
  value.
\item  shape [symbol] The symbol shape to use. One of circle (default),
  square, cross, diamond, triangle-up, or triangle-down (symbol only)
\item  innerRadius [arc] The inner radius of the arc, in pixels.
\item  outerRadius [arc] The outer radius of the arc, in pixels.
\item  startAngle [arc] The start angle of the arc, in radians.
\item  endAngle [arc] The end angle of the arc, in radians.
\item  interpolate [area, line] The line interpolation method to use. One
  of linear, step-before, step-after, basis, basis-open, cardinal,
  cardinal-open, monotone.
\item  tension [area, line] Depending on the interpolation type, sets the
  tension parameter.
\item  url [image] The URL from which to retrieve the image.
\item  align [image, text] The horizontal alignment of the object. One of
  left, right, center.
\item  baseline [image, text] The vertical alignment of the object. One of
  top, middle, bottom.
\item  text [text] The text to display.
\item  dx [text] The horizontal margin, in pixels, between the text label
  and its anchor point. The value is ignored if the align property is center.
\item  dy [text] The vertical margin, in pixels, between the text label
  and its anchor point. The value is ignored if the baseline property is
  middle.
\item  angle [text] The rotation angle of the text, in degrees.
\item  font [text] The typeface to set the text in (e.g., Helvetica Neue).
\item  fontSize [text] The font size, in pixels.
\item  fontWeight [text] The font weight (e.g., bold).
\item  fontStyle [text] The font style (e.g., italic).
}

To each property, you can assign any property object (\code{\link{prop}})
either locally (i.e. in the mark), or in a parent \code{layer}.
