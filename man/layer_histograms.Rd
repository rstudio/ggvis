\usage{
layer_histograms(vis, ..., width = NULL, center = NULL, boundary = NULL,
  right = TRUE, stack = TRUE)

layer_freqpolys(vis, ..., width = NULL, center = NULL, boundary = NULL,
  right = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{vis}{Visualisation to modify}

\item{...}{Visual properties used to override defaults.}

\item{width}{The width of the bins. The default is \code{NULL}, which
yields 30 bins that cover the range of the data. You should always override
this value, exploring multiple widths to find the best to illustrate the
stories in your data.}

\item{center}{The center of one of the bins.  Note that if center is above or below
the range of the data, things will be shifted by an appropriate number of \code{width}s.
To center on integers,
for example, use \code{width = 1} and \code{center = 0}, even if \code{0} is
outside the range of the data.  At most one of \code{center} and \code{boundary} may be
specified.}

\item{boundary}{A boundary between two bins. As with \code{center}, things are shifted
when \code{boundary} is outside the range of the data. For example, to center on
integers, use \code{width = 1} and \code{boundary = 0.5}, even if \code{1} is outside
the range of the data.  At most one of \code{center} and \code{boundary} may be
specified.}

\item{right}{Should bins be right-open, left-closed, or
right-closed, left-open.}

\item{stack}{If \code{TRUE}, will automatically stack overlapping bars.}
