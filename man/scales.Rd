\title{Add a scale to a ggvis plot}
\arguments{
\item{vis}{A ggvis object.}

\item{scale}{The name of a scale, such as "x", "y", "fill", "stroke", etc.}

\item{type}{A variable type. One of "numeric", "nominal", "ordinal",
"logical", "datetime".}

\item{...}{other arguments passed to the scale function. See the help for
\code{\link{scale_numeric}}, \code{\link{scale_ordinal}} and
\code{\link{scale_datetime}} for more details. For example, you might
supply \code{trans = "log"} to create a log scale.}

\item{name}{If \code{NULL}, the default, the scale name is the same as
\code{scale}. Set this to a custom name to create multiple scales for
stroke or fill, or (god forbid) a secondary y scale.}
}
\description{
This creates a scale object for a given scale and variable type, and adds it
to a ggvis plot. The scale object is populated with default settings, which
depend on the scale (e.g. fill, x, opacity) and the type of variable (e.g.
numeric, nominal, ordinal). Any settings that are passed in as arguments
will override the defaults.
}
\section{Scale selection}{


ggvis supports the following types of scales. Typical uses for each scale
type are listed below:
\itemize{
  \item numeric For continuous numeric values.
  \item nominal For character vectors and factors.
  \item ordinal For ordered factors (these presently behave the same as
    nominal).
  \item logical For logical (TRUE/FALSE) values.
  \item datetime For dates and date-times.
}

Each type has a corresponding function: \code{scale_numeric},
\code{scale_nominal}, and so on.

The scale types for ggvis are mapped to scale types for Vega, which include
"ordinal", "quantitative", and "time". See \code{\link{ggvis_scale}} for more
details.

Given a scale and type, the range is selected based on the combination of the
\code{scale} and \code{type}. For example, you get a different range of
colours depending on whether the data is numeric, ordinal, or nominal. Some
scales also set other properties. For example, nominal/ordinal position
scales also add some padding so that points are spaced away from plot edges.

Not all combinations have an existing default scale. If you use a
combination that does not have an existing combination, it may suggest
you're displaying the data in a suboptimal way. For example, there is
no default for a numeric shape scale, because there's no obvious way to
map continuous values to discrete shapes.
