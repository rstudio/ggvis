#' Quick vis: a succint way of generating simple ggvis plot specifications.
#'
#' \code{qvis} is a succinct way of creating simple plots. It achieves this
#' succinctness by being a little bit magical and trying to guess what you
#' mean. It is most suitable for creating basic data graphics like scatterplots
#' and histograms. As you start creating more complicated plots, you'll
#' want to use \code{\link{ggvis}} directly to get more control and
#' avoid ambiguity.
#'
#' @section Compared to \code{qplot}:
#'
#' \code{qvis} is somewhat less powerful than \code{qplot}. \code{qvis}
#' contains the most commonly used arguments from \code{qplot}, but it
#' drops the many extra arguments that are easy to replicate by adding
#' the right component on to the plot.
#'
#' @param data The data set where
#' @param ... Properties and layer arguments.
#'
#'   If the name of the argument matches the name of a known property, it will
#'   be added to the plot properties. Otherwise it will be passed as an
#'   argument to every layer. If you want to pass different arguments to
#'   different layers, you'll need to add layers on one at a time.
#'
#'   The first two unnamed components are taken to be \code{x} and \code{y}.
#'   Any additional unnamed components will raise an error.
